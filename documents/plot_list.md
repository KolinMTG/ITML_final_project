# Plot List

Use this file to describe all registered .png in the plots folder. (Only in english please)

- [knn_neighbors_metrics](../plots/knn_neighbors_metrics.png) : KNN performance for different numbers of neighbors, evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, for classifying wine into two categories (white vs. red).

- [regression_multiple_model_perf](../plots/regression_multiple_model_perf.png) : Relative performance of multiple models, normalized to the top-performing ExtraTrees model, for wine-quality classification. Added real performances for top3 best models. Perf = Error

- [alcool_kde](../plots/alcool_kde.png) : Kernel density plot showing the distribution of alcohol content across wines.Highlights where most samples concentrate and how spread or skewed the values are.

- [free_vs_total_sulfure_dioxide_kde](../plots/free_vs_total_sulfure_dioxide_kde.png) :   KDE comparison between free and total sulfur dioxide. Medians and quartiles help visualize differences in concentration ranges and variability.

- [g_dm3_features_boxplot](../plots/g_dm3_features_boxplot.png) :   Boxplots (log scale) for several g/dm³ chemical features. Useful to detect skewness, spread, and potential outliers across variables.

- [ph_kde](../plots/ph_kde.png) : KDE showing the distribution of pH values in the dataset.  
  Helps observe the typical acidity range and how tightly values are clustered.


- [quality_kde](../plots/quality_kde.png) :  Distribution of wine quality scores estimated with KDE.  
  Makes it easier to see dominant quality levels and possible class imbalance.

- [PCA_explained_variance](../plots/PCA_explained_variance_results.png) : Cumulativ explained variance for PCA on dataset, with 95% threashold. 95% explained variance reach at 8 components

- [corr_matrix](../plots/corr_matrix.png) : Correlation matrix for each numerical columns of the dataset. 

- [corr_circle_2axes.png](../plots/corr_circle_2axes.png) : Correlation Circle for 2 mains components of PCA analysis, showing correlation between each features. 

- [all_features_pairplot](../plots/all_features_pairplot.png) : Pair plot and distribution for all feature with Hue=Type (White/Red)
